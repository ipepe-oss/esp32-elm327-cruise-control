# Honda Denso Actuator

## What is it
Denso MX100300-1170 throttle cable control motor from a Honda Accord 1.8 from 1998

## How it works
This module has an ordinary motor with an electromagnetic clutch. You can easily connect this module and test it. As for the wires themselves and their markings. The first wire is the ground for the clutch, the second is a plus for the clutch, the third and fourth is the power supply to the electric motor and here is a nice thing, because we control this motor like any DC motor, e.g. a window lifting motor in a car. Depending on the plus or minus combination, the motor loosens the cable or pulls it.

I read somewhere that electromagnetic clutch is disengaged the moment when You press brake pedal as a safety feature.
